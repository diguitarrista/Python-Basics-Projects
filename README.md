# Python-Basics-Projects

During my studies in Introduction to Computer Science 
I had three challenges to build a program using the 
techniques that the files are named after.

1. a simple version of the snake game using: strings, booleans and functions; 
2. a version of the snake game using: arrays; 
3. a simple bank system where the accounts are objects from the class Account: OOP and dictionaries.

I'm not using this in an academic level or for commercial purposes. 
These code are only to demonstrate programming technics and were all written by me (@diguitarrista).
