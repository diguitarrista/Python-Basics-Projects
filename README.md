# Python-Basics-Projects

During my studies in Introduction to Computer Science 
I had three challenges to build a program using the 
techniques that the files are named after.

1 - A simple version of the snake game using: strings, booleans and functions.
2 - A version of the snake game using: arrays.  
3 - A simple bank system where the accounts are objects from the class Account: OOP and dictionaries.

I'm not using this in an academic level or for commercial purposes. 
These code are only to demonstrate programming technics.
These code were all written by me (@diguitarrista).
